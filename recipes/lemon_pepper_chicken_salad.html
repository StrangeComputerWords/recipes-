        <h1>LEMON PEPPER CHICKEN W/ SPINACH SALAD</h1>
        <img src="../images/chicken.jpg" alt="This is not the end result of the recipe, just a stock photo.">
        <p>Like many great inventions, this recipe was created out of necessity.</p> 
        <p>My best buddy in the whole wide world and I had a real bad Wingstop phase. We were absolutely addicted to their lemon pepper fried chicken. Soon, we found ourselves hemorrhaging money; it was simply too good to stop ordering. Then, out of the blue, we came up with an idea...</p>
        <p><strong><em>WE WOULDN'T CRAVE WINGSTOP IF WE HAD A BETTER OPTION</em></strong></p>
        <p>And today I'm going to teach you what that better option is... here's what you'll need</p>

        <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Chicken Breast</li>
                <li>Lemon Pepper Seasoning</li>
                <li>Lemon</li>
                <li>Spinach</li>
                <li>Tofu<em> (extra firm)</em></li>
                <li>Apple</li>
                <li>Flour</li>
                <li>EVOO <em>(Extra Virgin Olive Oil)</em></li>
                <li>Salad Dressing <em>(it's your choice as to which one)</em></li>
            </ul>

        <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Begin by cutting the chicken into strips/clumps.</li>
                <li>Cut the lemon in half.</li>
                <li>Cut the block of tofu into cubes; place them in a container.</li>
                <li>Cut the apple into cubes; place those in a container as well.</li>
                <li>Place the chicken in a bowl and squeeze the lemon over the chicken. The goal is to let it marinate.</li>
                <li>Begin working on the breading. You're going to make a powdery combination of flour and lemon pepper seasoning.</li>
                <li>Toss the marinated chicken around in the flour. Make sure it's fully coated.</li>
                <li>When you have a good amount of coated chicken, begin heating up that EVOO in a skillet and add the chicken when the oil is hot.</li>
                <li>Put a lid over the chicken so you don't dry it out.</li>
                <li>Now's a good time to start frying the tofu, too. <strong><em>(Both the chicken and the tofu are going to take a while to cook, so it's best to start frying them both at the same time.)</em></strong></li>
                <li>While the proteins are cooking, put some spinach in a big bowl with the apples you cut earlier</li>
                <li>Apply salad dressing, then proceed to toss the salad. Make sure the apples are spread out.</li>
                <li>After sufficient tossing, you're going to place the greens and sweets on a plate... kind of like a bed for the proteins.</li>
                <li>When the proteins are done cooking, you're going to place both of them in the middle of the dish... or don't. Whatever works for you aesthetically.</li>
            </ol>
        <h3>PUT A FORK IN IT</h3>
        <h4>Because you're done, baby. You might want to salt that tofu though...</h4>
