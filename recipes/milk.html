        <p>Hey, man.</p>
        <p><em>I'm going to tell you a secret</em></p>
        <p>You see that glorius jar of lactose? We're not even supposed to drink that. Isn't that weird? I always thought it was weird. Don't get me wrong, I don't intend to go on some anti-omnivore rant, but one really needs to ask who was the first human to suck from a cow teet? And why? Was it because they were curious? Starving? Perverted? I have no idea.</p>
        <p>What I do know, though, is that we've stolen integral milk from the subsequent generation of bovines. Kinda messed up.</p>
