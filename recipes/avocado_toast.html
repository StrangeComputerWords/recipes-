        <h2>A Moderately Zesty Take On A Classic</h2>
        <p>I'm a huge fan of avocado toast, but I often hate the way others make the dish.</p>
        <p>Inventory check! Make sure you have these in your pantry before you move on.</p>

        <h3><strong>Ingredients (1 Serving)</strong></h3>
        <p><em>(easily scalable in case you have guests)</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>avocado</li>
            <li>lemon</li>
            <li>Dave's Bread <em>(preferred, but not required)</em></li>
            <li>egg</li>
            <li>alfalfa sprouts</li>
            <li>crushed red pepper</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>butter</li>
            <li>spinach</li>
            <li>siracha sauce <em>(optional)</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Skin the avocado, extract the seed, and place it in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Cut a lemon in half, and squeeze both halves over the avocado.</li>
            <li>Begin mashing the juicy-cado until it attains a paste-like consistency. This is a good time to add some salt. How much you'd like is up to your taste palette.</li>
            <li>Mix and mash the amalgamation until the salt is well-blended and there are no clumps.</li>
            <li>This is a good time to start boiling your eggs</li>
            <li>Begin toasting your bread. Although a conventional toaster would take less effort, it's important that you toast the bread on a pan with melted butter. Feel free to add/subtract butter depending on your diet.</li>
            <li>Once your bread is toasted, cut all of the slices into halves</li>
            <li>Begin applying your recently made avo-spread to the bread.</li>
            <li>Top <strong>one</strong> side of a slice of bread with alfalfa sprouts. You'll notice that the avo-spread you made gives the sprouts some stability on that bread. Try not to put too much; we still need to add the egg and it's mainly for aesthetic purposes anyway...</li>
            <li>Once the eggs are done boiling, crack them, cut them in half <em>(horizontally, not vertically)</em>, and firmly set the half-egg on toast/avocado/sprouts you prepared earlier</li>
        <p><strong>PROTIP:</strong> Do not set the egg on top of the sprouts! It'll fall off!</p>
            <li>Finally, top off your creation with a spinkling of crushed red pepper, an artistic drizzle of siracha sauce, and lastly, a single spinach leaf on top of the egg. Be sure to use the siracha as an adhesive for the spinach leaf.</li>
        </ol>
